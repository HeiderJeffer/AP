# TITLE: Misalignment between ownership and contribution affects system reliability
# PROBLEM STATEMENT	
"OCAM (Ownership and Contribution Alignment Model) is a tool for detecting the misalignment between ownership and contribution. It is the first step towards investigating the impact it might have on the faster accumulation of Technical Debt [Zabardast and Gonzalez-Huerta, 1, 2022]". Besides studying the TD, the OCAM didn't show any factors impacted by the misalignment between ownership and contribution, such as non-behavioral requirements and the system's reliability. The misalignment strike system reliability is a problem, not a feature, that needs to be addressed and answered.
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
The future research question addressed in this proposal is RQ: How does misalignment of ownership and contribution affect reliability.

# RESEARCH APPROACH	
We have a system with a misalignment problem between ownership and contribution. The misalignment problem strikes the system's reliability. A misalignment that affects system reliability is a misalignment between ownership and contribution that affects the quality of a system from performing consistently well.

-	Data Collection Steps (Wang Xiaofeng, 2379, 2016):
-	Import 193 cases of misalignment from BTH researchers [OCAM model has identified 193 cases of misalignment (Zabardast and Gonzalez-Huerta, 3, 2022)].
- Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- Identify cases from inclusion.
- Apply quality assurance criteria.
-	Data Analysis steps (Wang Xiaofeng, 2382, 2016):
- Extract relevant data from cases.
- Coding the data to identify types of misalignment factors affects system reliability.
- Grouping misalignment factors into identical categories based on (How they affected the system's reliability).

The overall data collection and analysis process employed in the study showing in Fig.1 UML diagram and explained in detail in the following text.
